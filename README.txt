1. The html file "Project_MktCap&Rating" is the main file, I download it from Jupyter Notebook, it contains all codes and explainations, you can walk through this file to get a clear view of my project.

2. All relevant codes are also in the .py file, however, to run the code, you must put the files in the folder "Required files for running the code" under the same path with the .py file.

3. The folder "Support files" contains some excel files used to calculate some values and draw pictures.
 
Looking forward to your precious comments on my project!
